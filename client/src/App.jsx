//! Keeper Rules !\\
/*
Our league format is a 3 keeper league, you franchise one player who is ðŸ”’.
Then select 3 more from your roster (you canâ€™t match position with franchise player) and they go into a lottery where 1 is randomly thrown back into the draft.
Can only keep players twice
- Undrafted Free Agents
We decided that they would go for an 8th round pick the first year and then jump 2 rounds every year afte
Our keeper league allows players to be kept in the round they were drafted and then increasing by 3 rounds each consecutive season up to their ADP. 
- no keepers in first 2 rounds
-trade still uses value- fibanacci for keepers
